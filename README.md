# python scripts for pentester
Here are the lists of useful scripts I use for pentest.

## Instructions
- python3 directoryEnumeration.py <target_IP_address>: _directory enumeration from wordlist_
- python3 networkScanner.py: _use ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network. In the script, change 192.168.1.0/24 to your LAN network ID, and change the interface from eth0 to the one showing in your ifconfig._
